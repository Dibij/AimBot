⚠ Not Perfect – Still in Progress
This aimbot is not flawless – it's still a work in progress.
It lags, is inconsistent, and may not always work as expected.
Expect bugs, slow FPS, and imperfections in detection and aiming.
Do NOT expect a fully polished cheat – this is just an experiment.

🎥 Inspiration
This project was inspired by Chessy AI on YouTube, who creates AI-based aimbots and automation scripts.
